 ### GIF from Videos using ffmpeg
```
ffmpeg -ss 00:00:00.000 -i input.mp4 -filter:v "setpts=PTS/10" -r 12 -s 640x480 -t 00:00:10.000 output.gif
```

The gif output will be 10x sped up and will have an output fps of 12fps at 640x480. It can also be used for slowing down. Also, when speeding up, note that this method will drop frames to achieve the desired speed. You can avoid dropped frames by specifying a higher output frame rate than the input. For example, to go from an input of 4 FPS to one that is sped up to 4x that (16 FPS)

### GIF from images

```
convert -delay 100 -loop 0 *.jpeg animatedGIF.gif
```

Use imagemagick. `delay` specifies time between frames, default unit is _hundredths of a second_  (in 1/100th of a second) to pause after drawing the images. SO the above example will pause 100/100 th  =  1 Second between frames.
and `loop` indicates how many loops to run. When you choose 0, it will run infinitely.

use [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/)'s GIF optimizer to reduce the size:

```
convert -layers Optimize output.gif output_optimized.gif
```


or using ffmpeg  
```
ffmpeg -i %06d.png output.gif
```
